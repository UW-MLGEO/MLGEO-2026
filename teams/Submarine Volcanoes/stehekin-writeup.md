# Multimodal Data Reveal Climatic Connections to Stehekin, WA Debris Flows in December, 2025
In December, 2025, atmospheric rivers brought significant rainfall to the North Cascades. This coincided with massive debris flows in the nearby town of Stehekin, WA, which was affected by forest fires in recent years. Without forest root systems to hold the soil, this region was sensitive to debris flows given sufficient soil moisture levels. While exact soil moisture can be challenging to measure, total precipitation and river gauge data can present a cohesive picture of rainfall and soil drainage, the two factors controlling soil moisture.

To visualize the relationship between these variables, multimodal data are pulled from APIs and plotted below.

## USGS Stream Gauge Data
Visualizing USGS daily stream gauge data from Stehekin, WA in December, 2025, we see that the gauge maxima occurs on December 11, with a volumetric flux of 14,000 cubic feet per second (Fig. 1). This measure serves as an excellent proxy for soil moisture, as it captures flux into the system (rainfall) and flux out of the system (river drainage).

## NOAA Precipitation Data
To be added.

## PNSN Seismic Data
Plotting several days of data around the stream gauge maxima from the UW.DREAM three-component seismometer station in Stehekin, WA, it is clear that long-period debris flows occured across the day of the stream gauge maximum (Fig. 2). This represents a critically oversaturated soil post-burn, which quickly washes out as debris flows across December 11 and in more brief periods over the following days.

## Data Accessbility
We use data from USGS for stream gauge data, NOAA for precipitation data, and IRIS for seismic data from the UW PNSN network. We use data from the December 2025 in the Stehekin, WA region. All data is freely available online from these APIs.
