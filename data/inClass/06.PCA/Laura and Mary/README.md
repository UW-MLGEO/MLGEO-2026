## PCA In-Class Assignment
### Laura Thomas and Mary Orrand

In this folder, we have constructed a python notebook and markdown file. These files explore Alaskan glacier data, provided via Google Drive to the MLGEO 2026 class. The purpose of the assignment is to practice PCA on a dataset and explore which features characterize glaciers in Alaska. 

Code is implemented in LauraMaryInClass.ipynb. All associated figures can be found in the Images folder. The lauramaryinclass.md file explores results and explains our PCA implementation and feature selection processes.
