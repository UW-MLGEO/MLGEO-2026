## Selected Variables From PCA
1. On PC1, lmax_m (maximum centerline length) is almost perfectly negatively correlated, with a loading close to -1, so on the same axis as PC1 but opposite
2. On PC2, zmin_m, zmax_m, zmed_m (Min elevation, max elevation, median elevation) have loading around 0.5, increasing together and each contributing to PC2 variance

## Summary of PCA
PC1 is focused on variance of centerline length and PC2 is a focus on all 3 elevation variables.
